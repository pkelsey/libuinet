UINET (User INET)
=============================================================================

This is a user-space port of the FreeBSD TCP/IP stack, begun with the
FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE sources and many pieces of Kip Macy's user-space
port of an earlier version of the FreeBSD stack, libplebnet.

Unlike the stock FreeBSD TCP/IP stack, this stack can initiate and
terminate arbitrary TCP/IP connections, including those on
arbitrarily-nested VLANs.  Listen sockets can be bound to a wildcard
IP address (across everything on the wire, not just local interfaces),
wildcard port, and specific VLAN tags stacks.  L2 information for
accepted connections is available to the application.  Outbound
connections can be bound to any IP and port, as well as any MAC
address and VLAN tag stack.

Packet I/O is currently accomplished via netmap.


Building libuinet
=============================================================================

cd network/uinet/lib/libuinet
gmake

If your netmap includes are not in the system include path,

gmake NETMAP_INCLUDES=<path to netmap includes>


Building the sample programs
=============================================================================

The sample programs are libev-based, so in addition to building
libuinet before building them, you must also build the libev port.

To build the libev port:

cd network/uinet/lib/libev
./configure --with-uinet=../libuinet/api_include
make

To build the sample programs:

cd network/uinet/bin/<prog>
gmake


The currently functioning sample programs are:

echo		A loopback server
echo++		A C++ loopback server
tproxy		A transparent proxy
